The Answer to the "Monty Hall" Problem - Demonstrated through manual testing with a really nice looking GUI.

You are on a gameshow where ->
🚪🚪🚪 - You have three doors to pick from.
Behind two doors there is a goat🐐 and behind one there is a fancy car🏎
You are given the option to pick a door to be yours. 
After you pick your door the host🕺 opens ONE 🚪 revealing a 🐐.
He then gives you the option to switch your 🚪 or keep it.

What do you do?

Run my app and get that answer as you manually play the scenario out again and again and again....
